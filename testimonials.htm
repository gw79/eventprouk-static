<p>The service they have provided has been reliable, flexible and cost-effective. Their services cover the whole spectrum from ideas for events, sourcing the venue, arranging AV to registration of delegates, which has been second to none.  They have always kept us well informed throughout the planning stage, which has included alerts to the number of delegates registered to any issues that may have arisen.  They have always dealt with queries in a professional and timely manner.</p>
<p>At the events themselves, the team is well organised and professional and have demonstrated tact and diplomacy with both speakers and delegates who can be challenging on occasions.</p>
<p>If there have been any out of the ordinary requests the team at Eventpro UK have always risen to the challenge.</p>
<p>I would have no hesitation in recommending Eventpro UK to others and would continue using them in the future</p>
<cite>&ndash; Claire Henry, National Programme Director, National End of Life Care Programme</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In terms of venue finding, the knowledge of both what is available and what works is astounding. Understanding what we think, we need, and what we actually want to do &ndash; then creating a mental model of what will work; then going to find a venue that delivers all that; this is a truly bespoke element. I have never yet been disappointed.</p>
<p>Truly professional and client focussed. From the level of one:one personal service, you could believe you were their only client ... But then you see how good they are and realise that you can&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>What is really impressive is that the team remember my speakers even if they have only met them once before. They make them feel like they are special and that makes them feel good &ndash; at a time when they are being asked to perform in front of an audience. It&rsquo;s these little things that make the events work.</p>
<p>They work as a real team &ndash; so it doesn&rsquo;t matter who is there on the day &ndash; you just know it&rsquo;s going to be OK</p>
<p>In any conference; you will have invested significant money, time and organisational reputation &ndash; you know this is safe in the Eventpro team&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine wanting to use any other company to undertake this work for me. I can&rsquo;t see how anyone could perform better than Eventpro UK</p>
<p>In my experience, they are not just a good choice, they are the only choice</p>
<cite>&ndash; Tim Cooper, Associate Director, Radiotherapy</cite><br /></blockquote>
<blockquote>Marie has run two conferences for me, one national and one international. I have recently contracted with her to run four more events for me. I have always found Eventpro to be a very professional organisation; very well run, organised and customer focused. The participants coming to the events Marie has run on my behalf have always commented on Eventpro UK&rsquo;s friendly and high quality style that gives them confidence in the event and all that goes with it.I would have no hesitation in recommending Eventpro UK.<cite> &ndash; Jim Thomas, Programme Head, Skills for Care</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>Just a short note to thank you all for the highly professional and well organised conference for the National Radiotherapy community. To get 250 people from across the country, all together at the same time - and making it look so easy, is fantastic. A well planned and prepared event - your help was invaluable. Nothing seems to faze you; everything was anticipated and dealt with<cite> &ndash; Radiotherapy Dept</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>I really do think that they way you looked after all the delegates helped to make the day more of a success than I envisaged. The Eventpro UK team was excellent and I will recommend you whenever I get the opportunity.<cite>&ndash; Department of Health</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>I just wanted to say a huge thanks to all of you for making yesterday the success it was. It is a privilege to work with you.<cite>&ndash; Roland Valori, National Endoscopy Team.</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>We all very much enjoy working with you all and find you an excellent and very efficient team to work with. We would never look anywhere else for such a service and we do hope to continue to work with you long into the future. <cite>&ndash; Keri Thomas, Gold Standards Framework Team</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>I would like to thank you for your fantastic organisation and support last week, the conference organisation went without a hitch, you did an excellent job &ndash; everybody commented on how supportive and helpful you were <cite> &ndash; National Endoscopy Programme</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>Thank you also for all your support for the programme, and your intense desire to get everything absolutely right.<cite> &ndash; Roland Valori &ndash; National Endoscopy Team.</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>I just wanted to drop you a line personally, to say a huge thank you for all you did in organising such a successful conference on Tuesday, it went totally without a hitch!. I think that you did a great job, first class lay out, first class organisation, good refreshments readily available, great facilities: you did a wonderful job, you are such an asset.<cite>&ndash; Wolverhampton University</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>You and Dave were wonderful as usual and I can&rsquo;t thank you enough - I know you say it's all part of the service but you went above and beyond and it's much appreciated. I shall be happy to recommend you to anyone <cite>&ndash; Sara Hiom, Director of Information, Cancer Research UK</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>Thank you so much for such a warm reception at the conference, and well done to you and your fabulous team for putting together such a flawless and well executed event - it was all a total pleasure! <cite>&ndash; Delegate, NCIN Conference 2011</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>Without your time, expertise &amp; contribution, the event wouldn&rsquo;t have been the success it was <cite>&ndash; Jane Whittome, Associate Director, National Cancer Action Team</cite></blockquote>
